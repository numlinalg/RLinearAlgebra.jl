# Title Formatting
Please format your Pull Request title according to the Conventional Commits specification. This is crucial for automating our release process.

Based on the changes in your PR, please use one of the following prefixes in your title:

- fix: for a bug fix.

Example: fix: correct user authentication flow

- feat: for a new feature.

Example: feat: add user profile page

- For breaking changes, you must signify this in one of two ways:

  - Append a ! after the type in the title.

    Example: feat!: remove user endpoint

  - Include a footer in your PR description below that starts with BREAKING CHANGE:.
