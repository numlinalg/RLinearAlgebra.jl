Without careful thought progress tracking can undermine the benefits of the iterative sketching procedure. For instance, the update to the sketch is computed using only a sketch of the matrix, SA in mathcalR^p times n, p ll m, and constant vector Sb in mathcalR^p; however, the residual computation requires the accessing the full matrix A to compute.
