The log assumes that the full linear system is available for processing. The goal of     this log is usually for research, development or testing as it is unlikely that the     entire residual vector is readily available.\n\nFields\n\ncollection_rate::Int64, the frequency with which to record information to append to the   remaining fields, starting with the initialization (i.e., iteration 0).\nresid_hist::Vector{Float64}, retains a vector of numbers corresponding to the residual   (uses the whole system to compute the residual)\nresid_norm::Function, a function that accepts a single vector argument and returns a   scalar. Used to compute the residual size.\niterations::Int64, the number of iterations of the solver.\nconverged::Bool, a flag to indicate whether the system has converged by some measure\n\nConstructors\n\nCalling LSLogFull() sets collection_rate = 1, resid_hist = Float64[],   resid_norm = norm (Euclidean norm), iterations = -1, and converged = false.\nCalling LSLogFull(cr::Int64) is the same as calling LSLogFull() except   collection_rate = cr.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"api/linear_solver_logs/#Log-Function","page":"Linear Solver Logs","title":"Log Function","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"api/linear_solver_logs/","page":"Linear Solver Logs","title":"Linear Solver Logs","text":"RLinearAlgebra.log_update!(::Nothing,::LinSysSampler,::AbstractVector,::Tuple,\n  ::Int64,::Any,::Any)","category":"page"},{"location":"api/linear_solver_logs/#RLinearAlgebra.log_update!-Tuple{Nothing, LinSysSampler, AbstractVector{T} where T, Tuple, Int64, Any, Any}","page":"Linear Solver Logs","title":"RLinearAlgebra.log_update!","text":"log_update!(\n    log::LinSysSolverLog,\n    sampler::LinSysSampler,\n    x::AbstractVector,\n    samp:s:Tuple,\n    iter::Int64,\n    A,\n    b)\n\nA common interface for specifying different strategies for updating the log with supertype     LinSysSolverLog.
