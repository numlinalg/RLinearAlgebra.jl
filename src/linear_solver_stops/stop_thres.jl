    LSStopThreshold <: LinSysStopCriterion

A structure that specifies a threshold for sufficient progress as a stopping critertion. That is, once a progress estimator 
    achieves a certain quality of solution, it stops.

# Fields
- `max_iter::Int64`, the maximum number of iterations.
- `threshold::Float64`, the value threshold for when sufficient progress has been achieved.
