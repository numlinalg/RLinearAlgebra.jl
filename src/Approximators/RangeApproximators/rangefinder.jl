    RangeFinder

A struct that implements the Randomized Range Finder technique which uses compression from 
    the right to form an low-dimensional orthogonal matrix ``Q`` that approximates the 
    range of ``A``. See [halko2011finding](@cite) for additional details.

# Mathematical Description
Suppose we have a matrix ``A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times n}`` of which we wish to form a low 
    rank approximation that approximately captures the range of ``A``. Specifically, we wish
    to find an Orthogonal matrix ``Q`` such that ``QQ^\\top A \\approx A``. 

A simple way to find such a matrix is to choose a ``k`` representing the number of 
    vectors we wish to have in the subspace. Then we can generate a compression matrix 
    ``S\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n \\times k}`` and compute ``Q = \\text{qr}(AS)``. 
    With high probability we will have ``\\|A - QQ^\\top A\\|_2 \\leq
    \\sqrt{k+1} (\\sum_{i=k+1}^{\\min{(m,n)}}\\sigma_{i})^{1/2}``, 
    where ``\\sigma_{k+1}`` is the ``k+1^\\text{th}`` singular value 
    of A (see Theorem 10.5 of [halko2011finding](@cite)). This bound is often conservative 
    as long as the singular values of ``A`` decay quickly.  
    
When the singular values decay slowly, we can improve the quality of the approximation using the 
    power iteration, which applies ``A`` and ``A^\\top``, ``q`` times 
    and take the qr factorization of ``(AA^\\top)^q AS``. Using these power iterations increases the 
    relative gap between the singular values leading to  better Rangefinder performance. 

Performing power iterations in floating points can destroy all information 
    related to the smallest singular values of ``A`` 
    (see Remark 4.3 in [halko2011finding](@cite)). We can preserve this information by 
    orthogonalizing inbetween the products of ``AS`` with ``A`` or ``A^\\top`` 
    in the power iteration. These steps are known as the orthogonalized power 
    iteration (see Algorithm 4.4 of [halko2011finding](@cite)).  
    Orthogonalized power iterations progress according to the following steps:

1. ``\\tilde{A}_1 = AS``  
2. ``Q_1,R_1 = \\textbf{qr}(\\tilde{A}_1)``  
3. ``\\tilde{A}_2 = A^\\top Q_1``  
4. ``Q_2,R_2 = \\textbf{qr}(\\tilde{A}_2)``  
5. ``\\tilde{A}_1 = A Q_2``  
6. ``Q_1, R_1 = \\textbf{qr}(\\tilde{A}_1)``  
7. Repeat Steps 3 through 6 for the desired number of power iterations 
   set ``Q = Q_1``.

    with orthogonalization.
