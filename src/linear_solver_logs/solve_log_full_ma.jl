    LSLogFullMA <: LinSysSolverLog

A mutable structure that stores information about a randomized linear solver's behavior.
    The log assumes that only a random block of full linear system is available for processing. 
    The goal of this log is usually for all use cases as it acts as a cheap approximation of the 
    full residual.

# Fields
- `collection_rate::Int64`, the frequency with which to record information to append to the
    remaining fields, starting with the initialization (i.e., iteration 0).
- `ma_info::MAInfo`, structure that holds information relevant only to moving average, 
   like the two choices of moving average widths (lambda1 and lambda2), the current moving average
   width (lambda), a flag to indicate which moving average regime, between lambda1 and lambda2, is 
   being used, a vector containing the values to be averaged (res_window), and an indicator of where 
   the next value should be placed (idx).
- `resid_hist::Vector{Float64}`, a structure that contains the moving average of the error proxy, 
   typically the norm of residual or gradient of normal equations.
- `iota_hist::Vector{Float64}`, a structure that contains the moving average of the error proxy, 
   typically the norm of residual or gradient of normal equations.
- `width_hist::Vector{Int64}`, data structure that contains the widths used in the moving average 
   calculation at each iteration.
- `resid_norm::Function`, a function that accepts a single vector argument and returns a
    scalar. Used to compute the residual size.
- `iterations::Int64`, the number of iterations of the solver.
- `converged::Bool`, a flag to indicate whether the system has converged by some measure.
- `sampler::DataType`, a data type that is needed for computing constants used in the uncertainty
  quantification and stopping steps. This is updated with each `log_update!` call. 
- `max_dimension::Int64`, a value that stores the max between the row and column dimension needed for
  computation of stopping criterion and uncertainty sets.
- `block_dimension::Int64`, a value that stores the sampling block dimension for the 
  computation of stopping criterion and uncertainty sets.
- `sigma2::Union{Float64, Nothing}`, a value that stores the sigma^2 parameter of a sub-Exponential
  distribution used for determining stopping criterion and uncertainty sets.
- `omega::Union{Float64, Nothing}`, a value that stores the omega parameter of a sub-Exponential
  distribution used for determining stopping criterion and uncertainty sets.
- `eta::Float64, a parameter that allows the adjustment of the uncertainty quantification if the 
  size of the default covariance is too wide for the particular problem.
- `true_res`, a boolean indicating if we want the true residual computed instead of approximate.
# Constructors
- Calling `LSLogFullMA()` sets `collection_rate = 1`,  `lambda1 = 1`,
    `lambda2 = 30`, `resid_hist = Float64[]`, `iota_hist = Float64[]`, `width_hist = Int64[]`, 
    `resid_norm = norm` (Euclidean norm), `iterations = -1`, `converged = false`, 
    `sampler = LinSysVecRowDetermCyclic`, `max_dimension = 0`, `sigma2 = nothing`, `omega = nothing`,
    `eta = 1`, and `true_res = false`. The user can specify their own values of lambda1, lambda2, sigma2, omega, and eta using 
    key word arguments as inputs into the constructor.
