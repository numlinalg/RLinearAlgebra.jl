# Solving Consistent Linear Systems

A system linear of equations---that is, a linear system---is specified by a
  coefficient matrix, $A$, and a constant vector $b.$ A linear system is
  consistent if there exists at least one vector $x^*$ such that $Ax^* = b$. The
  set of vectors, $x^*$, satisfying $Ax^* = b$ are called solutions. A linear
  system can be solved by using a [Randomized Linear Solver](@ref), which
  leverages randomization to (hopefully) reduce the amount of computation or
  resources needed to (approximately) find a solution to a linear system.

Randomized linear solvers come in a number of varieties and under a number of
  names. In this library, a broad set of randomized linear solvers are
  encapsulated using a  flexible yet uniform interface that is described below.
  Once a randomized linear solver is specified, it is passed to a solver
  function (i.e., [`rsolve`](@ref) or [`rsolve!`](@ref)) along with the linear system, which
  then produces an approximate solution to the linear system.

We will begin by specifying the quickest way of solving a linear system by using
  the default linear solver. We will then show how to pass a user supplied
  randomized linear solver to [`rsolve`](@ref). Then, we will introduce the
  general interface for specifying randomized linear solvers.

## Solving a linear system using defaults

Given a consistent linear system whose coefficient matrix is specified in `A`
   and whose constant vector is provided in `b`, an approximate solution to the
   system is returned by calling `rsolve(A,b)`. For example, `sol` is an
   approximate solution to the generated system in the following script.

```julia
using RLinearAlgebra

# Generate a system
A = rand(20, 5);
x = rand(5);
b = A * x;

# Solve the system
sol = rsolve(A, b);
```

The default solver is hidden in the preceding example, but we can explicitly
  construct the default solver and pass it to [`rsolve`](@ref) as shown in the
  following script.

```julia
using RLinearAlgebra

# Generate a system
A = rand(20, 5);
x = rand(5);
b = A * x;

# Specify the default solver and stop it after 200 iterations
solver = RLSSolver(200);

# Solve the system
sol = rsolve(solver, A, b);
```

!!! warning
    Owing  to randomness, the two scripts will produce two different solutions.
    This is expected as randomized linear solvers do not have determinism. You
    can attempt to enforce this by specifying a seed if you wish to check that
    the solutions produced are identical.

In the above example, the randomized linear solver, `solver`, is given by the
  constructor [`RLSSolver`](@ref) with an argument `200`, which specifies the
  total number of iterations allowed before the algorithm must stop. While we
  have explicitly constructed the solver and passed it to [`rsolve`](@ref), we
  still have hidden many of the components of the randomized solver. In the
  next section, we discuss these components.

!!! note
    For an in-place solver or to provide an initial iterate, see the
    documentation for [`rsolve!`](@ref).

## Components of a randomized linear system solver

A [Randomized Linear Solver](@ref) specifies the algorithm that is used to find
  an approximate solution to a linear system. In this library, a randomized
  linear solver is encapsulated by four general and flexible components.

- A **sampler** (i.e., sketch, selection) is a way of extracting row or
  column space information from a given linear system.
- A **routine** for generating a solution or updating an iterate given the
  information generated by the sampler.
- A **logger** for recording essential information about the behavior of the
  randomized linear solver.
- A **stopping condition** for determining when to terminate the linear solver
  (e.g., stopping at one iteration for a sketch-then-solve method).

These four components are the fields of an [`RLSSolver`](@ref) struct.
  Specifically, these fields are

- `sampler` which must be a subtype of [`LinSysSampler`](@ref). Subtypes of
  [`LinSysSampler`](@ref) specify the type of sampling/sketching/selection
  method being deployed. See [Linear Samplers](@ref) for a list of available
  samplers.
- `routine` which must be a subtype of [`LinSysSolveRoutine`](@ref). Subtypes of
  [`LinSysSolveRoutine`](@ref)specify the method for solving the system that
  results from applying the sampling method to the original linear system. See
  [Linear Subsolvers](@ref) for a list of available routines.
- `log` which must be a subtype of [`LinSysSolverLog`](@ref). Subtypes of
  [`LinSysSolverLog`](@ref) provides a struct that specifies what information
  is stored during execution of the algorithm. See [Linear Solver Logs](@ref)
  for a list of available logs.
- `stop` which must be a subtype of [`LinSysStopCriterion`](@ref). Subtypes of
  [`LinSysStopCriterion`](@ref) determine when the algorithm should stop, and
  often makes use of `log`. See [Linear Solver Stop Criteria](@ref) for a list
  of available stopping criteria.

## Example: A randomized Kaczmarz method

Suppose we have a consistent linear system with coefficient matrix $A$ and
  constant vector $b$.

!!! note
    The system can be overdetermined, square or underdetermined. The method will
    work regardless.

To solve this system, we will use a randomized linear solver which

1. Randomly cycles through the equations of the linear system. That is, it will
    randomly permute the equations of the system, cycle through this
    permutation, generate another random permutation of the equations of the system, and repeat this process until a stopping condition is reached.
2. Generates a sequence of iterates by projecting onto the hyperplane specified
    by the equation generated by the random cycling.
3. Records the (Euclidean) residual norms using the entire system at each
    iteration. For a random algorithm, it makes very little sense to compute the
    residual norm at each iteration or even at any iteration as this requires
    accessing the entire original system, which is likely inefficient for
    realistic problems.
4. The solver stops once the system's equations have been visited ten times
    each.

Each of these four components is addressed by the choice of `sampler`,
  `routine`, `log`, and `stop` condition. In sum, these four choices will
  be used to specify a `solver`.

1. The `sampler` that implements the random permutation cycling is implemented
    as [`LinSysVecRowRandCyclic`](@ref).
2. The `routine` that implements the projection onto the hyperplane is
    implemented as [`LinSysVecRowProjStd`](@ref).
3. The `log` that implements the residual tracking is implemented as  
    [`LSLogFull`](@ref).
4. The `stop` condition that implements the iteration requirement is
    implemented as [`LSStopMaxIterations`](@ref). We will pass the iteration at
    which we want the algorithm to stop as an argument.

This example solver can be implemented and used as follows.

```julia
using RLinearAlgebra

# Generate a system
A = rand(20, 5);
x = rand(5);
b = A * x;

# Specify solver
solver = RLSSolver(
    LinSysVecRowRandCyclic(),   # Random Cyclic Sampling
    LinSysVecRowProjStd(),      # Hyperplane projection
    LSLogFull(),                # Full Logger: maintains residual history
    LSStopMaxIterations(200),   # Maximum iterations stopping criterion
    nothing                     # System solution (not solved yet)
);

# Solve the system
sol = rsolve(solver, A, b)
```

## Block Methods for Linear Systems

Because of the way that computers operate, it is often more efficient to work using 
blocks of data rather than single vectors to generate updates to solutions.
