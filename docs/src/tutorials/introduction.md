# Introduction

The purpose of these tutorials is to use examples to help new users quickly get hands-on 
experience using `RLinearAlgebra.jl`.

## How tutorials are structured

Problem sets:
- Consistent system problem, solving $x$ s.t. $$Ax = b$$.
- Least squares problem, solving $x = \arg\displaystyle\min_{x}\|Ax - b\|_2^2$.
