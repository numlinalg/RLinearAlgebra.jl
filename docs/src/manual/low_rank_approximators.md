# Low-Rank Approximations of Matrices
Large matrices often contain redundant information. This means that it is 
possible to form representations of large matrices with less data than what the 
original matrix contains. 
One way of representing a matrix with less data is through
low-rank approximations. 
Generally, low-rank approximations of
a matrix ``A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}`` take two forms: 
``
    A \approx MN,
`` 
where ``M \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times r}`` and ``N \in \mathbb{R}^{r \times n}``,
or 
``
A \approx MBN,
``
where ``M \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times r}``, ``N \in \mathbb{R}^{s \times n}``, and 
``B \in \mathbb{R}^{r \times s}``. 

Once one of the above representations has been obtained they can then be used 
to speed up a number of computations including
matrix multiplication, clustering, or approximate eigenvalue decompositions 
[halko2011finding, eckart1936approximation, udell2019why, park2025curing](@cite).
 
The type of approximation depends on the symmetry of the matrix. 
For symmetric matrices, we can use the Nystrom
approximation. For non-symmetric matrices, we can use 
the Generalized Nystrom decomposition or interpolative decompositions (IDs), 
which select subsets of the rows and/or columns of a matrix. If these interpolative 
decompositions are performed to select only columns or only 
rows then they are known as one-sided IDs, if they are used 
to select both columns and rows then they are known as a CUR decomposition. Below, we 
present a summary of the decompositions in a table. 

|Approximation Name|Matrix Type| Form of Approximation|
|:-----------------|:----------------|:---------------------|
|RandRangeFinder| General| ``A \approx QQ^\top A``|
|RandSVD|General|``A \approx U \Sigma V^\top``|
|Nystrom| Symmetric|  ``(AS)((SA)^\top AS)^\dagger(AS)^\top``|
|Generalized Nystrom| General|  ``(AS_1)(S_2A AS_1)^\dagger S_2 A``|
|CUR| Yes| Yes| General| ``(A[:,J])U(A[I,:])``|
|One-Sided ID| General|  ``A[:,J]U_c`` or ``U_r A[I,:]``|

In `RLinearAlgebra`, 
once you have obtained a low-rank approximation `Recipe`, you can use it 
to do multiplications (via `mul!`) and/or left inversion (via `ldiv!`). 
Below we have the table of approximation recipes 
and indicate how they can be used.

|Approximation Name| `mul!`| `ldiv!`|
|:-----------------|:------|:-------|
|RandRangeFinderRecipe| Yes| No|
|RandSVDRecipe|Yes| No|
|NystromRecipe|Yes| No|
|CURRecipe|Yes| No|
|IDRecipe (One-Sided ID)|Yes|No|

# The Randomized Rangefinder
The idea behind the randomized range finder is to find 
an orthogonal matrix ``Q`` such that
``A \approx QQ^\top A``. [halko2011finding](@citet) showed that 
forming ``Q`` was as simple as compressing ``A`` from the right  
and storing the ``Q`` from the
resulting QR factorization. 
Despite the simplicity of this procedure,
 if the compression dimension, ``k``, exceeds 2, then
``\|A - QQ^\top A\|_F \leq \sqrt{k+1} (\sum_{i=k+1}^{\min{(m,n)}}\sigma_{i})^{1/2}``, 
where ``\sigma_{k+1}`` is the ``k+1^\text{th}`` singular value of ``A`` 
[halko2011finding; Theorem 10.5](@cite). 
This is very close to the error from the truncated SVD, which 
is known to be the lowest achievable error. 
For matrices whose singular values decay quickly, this bound can be 
conservative in comparison to observed performance. 
However, for some matrices whose singular values 
decay slowly this bound is fairly tight. 
`RLinearAlgebra` implements the randomized rangefinder using 
[`RangeFinder`](@ref).

Power iterations can be added to improve the quality of the approximation.
Power iterations basically involve multiplying the matrix with itself, 
which results in raising each singular value to a 
higher power. This powering of the singular values increases the gap between the 
singular values making them easier to resolve.
In `RLinearAlgebra`, you can control the number of power iterations 
using the `power_its` keyword in [`RangeFinder`](@ref).

One issue with power iterations is that they can sometimes be 
unstable. 
We can improve the stability of these iterations by orthogonalizing between
power iterations (akin to Arnoldi iterations).
In `RLinearAlgebra` you can control whether or not the
orthogonalization is performed using the `orthogonalize` keyword argument in the 
[`RangeFinder`](@ref). 

!!! info 
    If the cardinality of the compressor in the `RangeFinder` is not `Right()` a warning 
    will be returned and the approximation may be inefficient or less accurate.  

## A RangeFinder Example
Let's say that we wish to obtain a five-dimensional Randomized Rangefinder approximation 
to matrix with 1000 rows and columns and a rank of five.
In `RLinearAlgebra`, we can easily do this with the Fast Johnson-Lindenstrauss
Compressor (see [`FJLT`](@ref)), say, as follows.

```julia
using RLinearAlgebra, LinearAlgebra

# Generate the matrix we wish to approximate
A = randn(1000, 5) * randn(5, 1000);

# Form the RangeFinder Structure
approx = RangeFinder(
    compressor = FJLT(compression_dim = 5, cardinality = Right())
)

# Approximate A
range_A = rapproximate(approx, A)

# Check the error of the approximation
norm(A - range_A * (range_A' * A))
```

### Adding Power Iterations with and without Orthogonalization

To see the benefits of power iterations, consider the same example but now with 
`compression_dim = 3`. 

Below, we first compute the best possible truncation error using 
a singular value decomposition of rank 3.
Then, we compute the Randomized Rangefinder _without_ the power iteration.
Then, we compute the Randomized Rangefinder _with_ the power iteration.
Finally, we compute the Randomized Rangefinder _with_ the power iteration _and_ 
orthogonalization.

```julia
# Get error of truncated svd by computing the sqrt of the sum^2 of singular values 4:1000
printstyled("Error of rank 3 truncated SVD:",
    sqrt(sum(svd(A).S[4:end].^2)),
    "\n"
)

# Try approximating with a compression dimension of 3 and no power its/orthogonalization 
# Form the RangeFinder Structure
approx = RangeFinder(
    compressor = FJLT(compression_dim = 3, cardinality = Right())
);

range_A = rapproximate(approx, A);

printstyled("Error of rank 3 approximation:",
    norm(A - range_A * (range_A' * A)),
    "\n"
)

# Now consider adding power iterations 
approx_pi = RangeFinder(
    compressor = FJLT(compression_dim = 3, cardinality = Right()),
    power_its = 10
);

range_A_pi = rapproximate(approx_pi, A);


printstyled("Error with 10 Power its and Orthogonalization:",
    norm(A - range_A_pi * (range_A_pi' * A)),
    "\n"
)

# Now consider power its with orthogonalization
approx_pi_o = RangeFinder(
    compressor = FJLT(compression_dim = 3, cardinality = Right()),
    power_its = 10,
    orthogonalize = true
);

range_A_pi_o = rapproximate(approx_pi_o, A);

printstyled("Error with 10 Power its and Orthogonalization:",
    norm(A - range_A_pi_o * (range_A_pi_o' * A)),
    "\n"
)
```
# The RandSVD
The RandomizedSVD is a form of low-rank approximation that returns the approximate 
singular values and vectors of the truncated SVD. Algorithmically, it is implemented as
three additional steps to the Randomized Rangefinder in [halko2011finding](@cite). 
Specifically these steps are:
1. Take the ``Q`` matrix from the Randomized Rangefinder and compute ``Q^\top A``.  
2. Compute the ``W,S,V = \text{svd}(Q^\top A)``.
3. Obtain the left singular vectors from ``U = Q^\top W``.

Since, the RandomizedSVD is simply an extension of the Randomized RangeFinder, the effects
of all modifications, such as power iterations and orthogonalization still apply.  The 
difference between the two procedures is found in the Recipes. Where for the `RandSVDRecipe`
you find a approximate truncated SVD where the singular values can be accessed by 
calling `recipe.S`, the left singular vectors can be accessed by calling `recipe.U`,
and the right singular vectors can be accessed by calling `recipe.V`. Additionally, 
when you multiply with the RandomizedSVD it is as if you are multiplying with the 
truncated SVD, meaning for a vector ``x`` the operation ``USV^\top x`` is performed. This 
type of multiplication can be substantially faster than multiplications with the original 
matrix.

!!! info
    As for the RandomizedSVD if the cardinality of the compressor is not `Right()` a warning 
    will be returned and the approximation may be incorrect.

## A RandSVD example
We now demonstrate how to use the RandSVD, by first generating the technique structure 
with a `FJLT` compressor with `compression_dim = 5` and `cardinality = Right()`. Then we 
will run `rapproximate` and compare the singular values of the returned recipe to the 
5 singular values of the truncated SVD. We will then end the experiment by comparing 
the difference between multiplying a our `RandSVDRecipe` to vector and multiplying the 
original matrix.

```julia
using RLinearAlgebra, LinearAlgebra

# Generate the matrix we wish to approximate
A = randn(1000, 5) * randn(5, 1000);

# Form the RangeFinder Structure
approx = RandSVD(
    compressor = FJLT(compression_dim = 5, cardinality = Right())
)

# Approximate A
randsvd_A = rapproximate(approx, A)

# Compare singular vectors
svd(A).S[1:5]

randsvd_A.S

# Compare multiplications
x = rand(1000);

norm(A * x - randsvd_A * x)
```

!!! info
    As for the RandomizedSVD if the cardinality of the compressor is not `Right()` a warning will be returned and the approximation may be incorrect.
